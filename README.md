### Installation
#### Clone the repository:

#### Install dependencies:
The React Todo List App uses several libraries and packages to help with development, building, and managing the application. Below is an overview of the main dependencies used in this project:

React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides a component-based architecture that enables the creation of reusable UI components.

axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests. It simplifies making asynchronous requests to the backend server.

react-icons: A library that provides a set of popular icons for use in React applications. Icons like FaCheck, FaEdit, and FaTrash are used in this app.

Development Dependencies
Node.js: A JavaScript runtime that allows you to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It's the foundation for building JavaScript applications on the server side.

npm: The Node.js package manager that is used to install and manage project dependencies.

#### Start the development server:
npm start
The app will run at http://localhost:3000. Before this, you should have your database running in the backend with "node index.js"

### Usage
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

You'll see a section for uncompleted tasks and another for completed tasks.

To add a new task, enter the task description in the input field and click the "Add" button.

To mark a task as complete or incomplete, click the "Mark Complete" or "Mark Incomplete" button, respectively.

To edit a task description, click the "Edit Description" button, make your changes, and click the "Update" button.
